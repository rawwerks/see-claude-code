# Feedback Session 2025-06-15
## Key Learnings:
- When user asks for a "new version" of a file, create a NEW file rather than editing the example
- Remove hardcoded commit references from feedback scripts - make them general for all repos
- Git tracking should use flexible fallback logic (HEAD~1, HEAD~2, etc.) instead of project-specific commits

## Git Context:
- Conversation: 4709ddb â†’ 9286de9 
- Major changes: Added log annotator UI, shadcn components, git tracking commands
